Intelligent JavaScript solution for file downloading.


Why DownloadJS?
---------------

- Avoids stupid blank screens after file starts downloading in Chrome, Safari.
- Ignores content type by using virtual link with "download" attribute. So file will be downloaded even if file`s content type says browser to show file`s content in new window. This allows to download PNGs, HTMLs and so on.
